WARMUP

1. Create a folder called AxiosWarmup, connect to Git/GitHub
2. Create an index.html and app.js, link them together
3. Add the axios script tag to your index.html page
4. Add a button into your HTML
5. When that button is clicked:
  5.1. Make an axios request to https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
  5.2. If successful, insert the image onto the page
  5.3. If not, show the user an error
  5.4. I recommend putting your debugger breakpoints in the success and failure functions
6. Add a second button onto the page
7. When the button is clicked:
  7.1. Make a request to https://picsum.photos/v2/list
  7.2. On success, show the user every image that is returned by the API
  7.3. On failure, show the user a failure message
  7.4. I recommend putting your debugger breakpoints in the success and failure functions
